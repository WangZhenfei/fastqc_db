Going through fastqc information manaully is no fun, so I made this
little module and a script to populate a sqlite database with information
retrieved from all of the "fastqc_data.txt" files generated by running
fastqc on a whole project's raw data.

The module just interfaces with python's sqlite3 library, probably
not optimally, and probably in a way that breaks somehow. In the database
generated, you will find two tables, 'basic' and 'module_stats', that
contain, respectively, the basic file information, and the results of the
tests run by fastqc. More tables coming soon

Usage:

    source set_vars.sh (just sets environment variables - have a look)
    ./fastqc_to_sqlite3.py

Then you can take a good look at your fastqc data using the database located
at $FASTQC_DB_NAME or (by default) ./fastqc.db.

    sqlite3 fastqc.db
    # SELECT * FROM basic;
    # SELECT basic.filename, module_stats.overall FROM basic, module stats
    WHERE basic.id = module_stats.id and module_stats.overall = 'fail';
    # ... whatever else you want to know

You can run tests on the db module by:

    python test_sqlite3_db.py
